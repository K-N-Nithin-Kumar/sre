                -> sudo usermod -a -G intern raju
                -> intern = Name of the group.
                -> raju = name of the member.
                -> -a =  Indicates us that we are appending.
                ->-G = Indicates us that group name that we are appending the user
                   (-G group name)
	     -> to list the group details (grep intern /etc/group)




Task -5
Add  two disks of 10GB each to this VM create a LVM using these two disks and Create XFS file system on it. Mount this on /data directory and make sure that mount persists on the across   		  the reboots.


-> To add 2 new disk to the the steps are as follows

 -> Click on the created Vm -> Settings-> Storage-> Controller: SATA->hard disk->create-> asks for the type of hard disk to be created (VDI-VirtualBox Disk Image) should be chosen->Continue->Dynamically allocated->select size and name-> Create.

->  To check the partition/name of the disk create.
    Command -> (sudo lvmdiskscan)

 -> Suppose the disks are /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc
-> to know the details 
-> fdisk -l /dev/sdb   and  fdisk -l /dev/sdc
->details of the particular disks will be obtained.
-> To do anything on the disk the mode should be in root user mode So command -> (sudo su).


LVM (Logical Volume Manager) ->In Linux, Logical Volume Manager is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel. Most modern Linux distributions are LVM-aware to the point of being able to have their root file systems on a logical volume.

It’s used in taking the secondary hard drive and add it to the main disk using LVM.

LVM Contains -> Physical Volume -> Volume groups->Logical Volumes.
Logical Volumes contains the partitions.

Steps followed are 

-> Create a physical Volume. (pvcreate /dev/sdb  and pvcreate /dev/sdc)

-> To display the physical volume created (pvs or pvdisplay)
     
 -> Create  volume groups and add the physical volumes created.

 -> vgcreate (name of the volume) /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
                               
-> vgcreate vol1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc

 -> To display the volume group.
 
-> vgdisplay /dev/vol1 (name of the volume group created previously)
  
-> Create Logical Volumes.
                        
 -> lvcreate -n (name of lv-group) —size (Desired size) (volume group)

 ->(lvcreate -n lv1 —size 19.9G vol1) 
	
-> Creating the XFS File system.

-> mkfs.xfs -f/dev/vol1/lv1.

->.xfs -> Indicates it is a xfs file system.

-> -f  -> file system created.

-> /dev/(volume group)/(logical volume)

-> Creating the Directory to mount file.

-> mkdir /data

-> mount /dev/vol1/lv1 /data

-> df -hT /data

-> The directory /data

->  mounting /dev/vol1/lv1   (to)  /data

-> df -hT /data -> To display the mounted data file in the directory)


Task -6 

Add another 10GB disk to the Vm and add it to existing LVM

-> Adding another 10GB disk.

-> Click on the created Vm -> Settings-> Storage-> Controller: SATA->hard disk->create-> asks for the type of hard disk to be created (VDI-VirtualBox Disk Image) should be chosen->Continue->Dynamically allocated->select size and name-> Create.


-> After adding the external disk we have to follow certain sets of commands
-> check the name of disks which was created (In my case it was /dev/sdc)
-> Create physical Volume by using pvcreate /dev/sdc
->The physical volumes were already created and we are adding extra 10GB disk size.

 -> So, use command (vgextend vol1/dev/sdc). vol1= Name of the volume group 
 -> To display the details of the volume groups use (vgdisplay vol1

->  Note -> Copy down the (FreePe) Value. Ex -> FreePe : 2582
         -> extend the logical volume. (Lvextend -l -t 2582 /dev/vol1/lv1)
         -> The above command is used for resizing and adding the creating disk into the logicalVolume. 
		 
SUBTASK  ->(Should be done for task 5 and task 6)- To mount logical Volume permanently.				   

-> blkid -> This command is used to obtain the block devices and the type of content a block device holds, the attributes from the content metadata.

-> sudo blkid /dev/vol1/lv1.  (Vol1 -> volume group, lv1 ->Logical Volume)
->  Copy the UUID ( Universally unique identifier) 
-> in my case UUID= 637476f4-3fc5-4775-b477-3527f65f9bf0.
-> In the  etc/fstab file.
-> Open /etc/fstab file.
-> vi or nano editor can be used.
-> vi /etc/fstab.
-> Traverse to the last and type.
-> (UUID=637476f4-3fc5-4775-b477-3527f65f9bf0 /data xfs defaults 0 0.)
-> sudo mount -a  (or) sudo mount /data
-> mount = instructs the Operating system that the file is read to use.
-> reboot to check if the mount persists.


Task - 7

Run a HTTP server on the Vm and make sure that the server starts automatically when the system starts. 

-> HTTP Server ->  A HTTP or a web server processes requests via HTTP , a network protocol used to exchange information on the World Wide Web(WWW). The main Function of a HTTP server is to store, process and deliver webpages to clients.

-> Firstly, in the created VM click on -> Settings->Network-> Change ->(Attached to Nat to Bridged adapter).

		

-> Open Terminal and install apache server 
->sudo apt update ( To check for any updates)
-> sudo apt install apache2 (To install apache webserver)
 ->sudo systemctl status apache2 ( To check the status of apache webserver)
-> sudo systemctl stop apache2(To stop apache2)
-> sudo systemctl restrart apache2(To start apache2)
-> To check the IP address of the system
-> (ip addr show) ->shows the IP address.
-> Go to the browser and paste the IP address found -> if it loads then it’s working properly.


		 
  
Task- 8

Mount /var/log on a separate mount point


-> The /var/log can be mounted onto the separate disk when there is no space on the root directory or the disk. Sometime the root directory gets filled and then mount /var/log onto the different directory.
 
-> /var, the case has the advantage of isolating applications filling the root from Interfering from /var, but this increases the chances that a filesystem will fill.

-> So, by filling the root directory would also cause a kernel panic. 

 -> The steps followed are as follows.
       
->   Add the additional disk for 10GB.
      
 -> To add the disks the steps to be followed as

       
->Click on the created Vm -> Settings-> Storage-> Controller: SATA->hard disk->create-> asks for the type of hard disk to be created (VDI-VirtualBox Disk Image) should be chosen->Continue->Dynamically 	  allocated->select size and name-> Create.
    	
 -> The /var/log can be moved by adding the external disks and directly copying as well.

-> This method is performed using the concept of creating the logical group ->creating  the directory-> go to the single user mode -> perform mount.
      
-> The steps and commands are as follows.
     
-> Using LVM create the logical values group.
    
->-> Create a physical Volume. (pvcreate /dev/sdc (the external disk created))
	
-> To display the physical volume created (pvs or pvdisplay)
     
      
-> Create  volume groups and add the physical volumes created.

-> vgcreate (name of the volume) /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
                               
-> vgcreate vol1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
                           
-> To display the volume group.
                               
-> vgdisplay /dev/vol1 (name of the volume group created previously)
  
              
-> Create Logical Volumes.
                        
                            
-> lvcreate -n (name of lv-group) —size (Desired size) (volume group)

->(lvcreate -n lv1 —size 19.9G vol1) 


-> Mount = create a directory -> mkdir /mnt/temp_vol (mnt = directory and temp_vol = file inside the directory)  
  		
-> Create ext4 file system only . (/var/log files are of type ext type)

-> mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vol1/lv1.    
Vol1->volume group and lv1->logical volume.
		 

 ->  mount -t ext4 /dev/vol1/lv1 /mnt/temp_vol/
-> to view the details or the contents of the file (ls-la /mnt/temp_vol/)
 -> Go To single user mode to  move the contents.
-> init 1
                 
->( mv /var/log/* /mnt/temp_vol).
 Var/log -> /temp/vol. (*)-> Everything 


-> To view the contents.
-> ls -l /var/log (Will show total=0)


->  View the contents of the /mnt/temp_vol.-> Umount -> logically detaching a filesystem from the currently accessible filesystem.

-> umount /mnt/temp_vol.

-> df -H (details of the disk)
                
 -> It should be mounted the /var/log
 		  
 ->Edit etc/fstab file.
   		   
->the fstab can be edited as.
                  
-> (echo /dev/vol1/lv1 /var/log ext4 defaults 0 0 >> /etc/fstab.)
                 
 ->  df -H it shows that it’s mounted.



Task- 9 
    
The users in the group interns should web able to login via a private key, and not a password.


-> This concept uses the SSH encryption where the public key and private key will be available for the users.

-> The SSH->  Means Secure Shell. Where the protocol is created where the operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

 -> The normal User id and password a particular user logs in the Password might be weak one or the Password can be hacked using various means.

 -> The SSH provides 2 keys the public keys and the Private keys  which can be used to authenticate the server.			  

 ->The steps followed are as follows.


 -> Creating 2 Virtual Machine’s which acts as a Server and Client.

-> In the Server Side the commands followed are as follows.

->The prerequisite is that the SSH server should be installed.

->It can be installed when we are in the creating phase of the new Vm where It asks to Install SSH.
                       
-> Or use command (sudo apt-get install SSH

-> To check the status (sudo systemctl status SSH)

		
IN THE SERVER SIDE. (Vm-1)
                      
-> create a user new user (sudo adduser name)
                         
-> Copy the particular IP- Address of the machine( copy and keep)
         
IN THE CLIENT SIDE. (Vm-2)
                     
-> Generate a Public and private key at the client side.
      			  
-> using (ssh -keygen).
                        
-> The key generated can be of SHA-256 or RSA Type.
 			   
-> Send the Public key -> (file ~/ssh/id_rsa)	 		   
->example -> username =raju.

-> ssh raju@ipaddress.
			   
-> copy the keys.
			   
-> ssh -copy -id @raju(ipaddress).        
                          
-> server IP address 10.0.2.15.
			     
-> change the configuration file at server	      	I

IN THE SERVER SIDE. (Vm-1)

-> sudo name /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
-> Change the settings in the file as
-> Password Authentication as (NO)		
-> When the user logs in for the first time it asks for password 
-> After that it’s directly logs in the user.

login via private key instead of password-(VM-2)

Change a user’s password
   ->sudo passwd username

switch to a user
 ->su -l username

run a command as a user: 
 ->sudo -u user command



IN THE CLIENT SIDE (VM-2)


cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub

To check if port 22 is active  ->sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

In some cases we have to install ssh if port 22 is not listening
 ->sudo apt-get install openssh-server
